#Slew duration vs. slew angle for WFIRST.
#Parameters:
#Maximum torque (N-m): 0.400
#Moment of inertia (pitch-yaw, kg-m^2):    32000
#Maximum angular rate (deg/sec):  0.120
#Maximum angular acceleration (rad/sec^2):    1.250e-05
#Rise time to reach maximum angular acceleration (sec):  2.000
#
#Slew types:
# 1 = Jerk-limited: acceleration never reaches maximum value.
# 2 = Acceleration-limited: angular rate never reaches maximum value.
# 3 = Rate-limited: angular rate does reach maximum value.
