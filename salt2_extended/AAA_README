Same as SALT2.Guy10, but with increased lambda range, 
extending from UV through IR.

BEWARE:
intended only for classification ... do NOT use for
precision applications such as distances.

===================

The RESTLAMBDA_RANGE file is used only by the SNANA version of SALT2 and was 
not used in Kessler 09.  The file in this dir was modified from the version 
in the SALT2.K09_LAMOPEN directory to extend the wavelength range.


Below the line is a modification of the README file as provided by J. Guy,

Data needed by SALT2 model
-----------------------------------

# SR: modified SALT2.INFO  appropriately.  Note that I had to fall back 
#  on linear interpolation of the SED flux, using : 
#       SEDFLUX_INTERP_OPT: 1  # 1=>linear,    2=>spline
# This may be a worry? 
SALT2.INFO

# SR: These two are untouched (is that right?)
salt2_color_correction.dat
RESTLAMBDA_RANGE.DAT

# SR: extrapolation guided by Hsiao SED template
salt2_template_0.dat

# SR:  ~flatline extension (from 8500 Ang on red side)
salt2_template_1.dat

#SR: smooth, ~flat extrapolations (manual)
salt2_color_dispersion.dat

# SR: The rest are flatline extrapolations (copying the first/last value across) :
salt2_lc_dispersion_scaling.dat
salt2_lc_relative_covariance_01.dat
salt2_lc_relative_variance_0.dat
